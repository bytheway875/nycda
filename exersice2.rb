#1. Use Ruby to do the following math problems. 
a = 5
b = 8
c = 12

d = a + b 
e = a + d 
f = d + e 

puts ("f")

#Then, puts the evalue of "f" to your terminal when you run the program!
 
 #2. Create an array of fruits. 
 fruits = ["apples", "oranges", "bananas"]

 #3. Using the fuits from your fruits array as keys, create a hash that 
 #includes the fruits (keys) and their colors (values)!
 fruit_color = [apples: "red", oranges: "orange", bananas:"yellow"]

 #4. Change the value for the color of one of your fruits.
bananas = brown



puts "What is your favorite color?"

color = gets.chomp

puts "#{color}, Thats my favorite color too!"
