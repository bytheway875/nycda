//Create a function that ADDS two numbers and returns the result
//Create a function that SUBTRACTS two numbers and returns the result
//Create a function that DIVIDES two numbers ( / is the division symbol) and returns the result
//Create a function that MULTIPLES two numbers (* is the multiplication symbol) and returns the result


// a = 6 * 4
//var a = multiply(6, 4);
//1. 
//a = 5 + 6

//b = 12 - 2

//c = a + b
//2.
//x = 5 * 6

//y = 80 / 12

//z = x * y
//3. 
//Now that you have solved for z and a, print the results to the console in this format:
//“The variable c is equal to *whatever c is* and the variable z is equal to *whatever z is*.”
//HINT: If you need help getting started with what your math functions should look like, think about what they each have in common. For all four operations, you’ll need to create a function that takes two arguments. The only thing different about them is which math operator you’ll use to calculate the result!
