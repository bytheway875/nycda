//Warmup Week 2, Day 2
//This should also be submitted as part of Week 2, Day 1 Homework assignment as part of the Programming & JS Basics Mini Challenges on //Canvas 
//Let’s declare some variables:
//Define variable named pet, which is a string of the name of one of your pets (or the pet you wish you had)
var pets = ("Nick");
//Define variable named toes, which is an integer of the number of toes you have
var toes = (10);
//Define a variable named tired, which is a boolean value of whether you feel tired or not right now!
var tired = true; 
//Let’s create some arrays:
//Define a variable named fruits, which is an array of three of your favorite fruits
var fruits = ["apples", "oranges", "grapes"];
//Define a variable named friends, which is a multi-dimensional array, including the names of three friends and their favorite color (make it up!)
var friends = [["Mike", "blue"], ["Pete", "red"], ["Tom", "purple"]];
//Let’s create some objects:
//Define a variable named person. Set it equal to an object with the attributes name, toeCount, and hairColor.
var person = ()
//Log to the console: 
//The person’s name
//The person’s toeCount
//The person’s hairColor
//Let’s create some functions:
//Define a function named squared. This should take one argument and return the square of the passed in value.
//Define a function named area. This should take two arguments (length and width) and multiply them to give you the area of a rectangle.
//EXTENSION:
//We didn’t learn these things in class. Use your new bff Google to see if you can figure out how to do these things in JS. 
//- Reverse your fruits array. 
//- Figure out how to generate a random number using javascript.
