Instance Variables:

floor - the floor you are currently on
Instance Methods:

The following methods will change the floor instance variable:
go_up - tell the elevator to go up a floor
go_down - tell the elevator to go down a floor
floor - set this as a readable attribute to be accessed outside of the class definition
cheery_greeting - display to the terminal the current floor with a interesting greeting
Use the cheery_greeting method to display your greeting every time you change floors
Challenge: If you are looking for a challenge then try these.

Prevent the go_up method from going past the 12th floor
Prevent the go_down method from going below the 1st floor
